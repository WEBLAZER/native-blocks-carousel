Gutenberg carousel slider block: transform any WordPress block into a responsive carousel with pure CSS. Zero JavaScript.

== Description ==

**Any Block Carousel Slider** is a Gutenberg carousel slider block plugin that instantly converts any native WordPress block (Gallery, Group, Grid, Query Loop, Post Template, WooCommerce Products, etc.) into a responsive carousel slider without adding a dedicated block or loading a JavaScript library. Simply enable the "Carousel" toggle in the Gutenberg editor: your content stays 100% native, your DOM stays lightweight, and your Lighthouse performance scores remain intact.

Unlike many all-in-one carousel slider blocks that require you to add a dedicated "Carousel" block and rebuild every slide, **Any Block Carousel Slider** hooks straight into the Gutenberg blocks you already use. The result: a WordPress loop, image gallery, or product grid can become a carousel slider in one click, without content duplication or extra maintenance.

= Try it now =

Test **Any Block Carousel Slider** instantly in your browser with [WordPress Playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/?plugin=native-blocks-carousel) – no installation required! Simply activate the plugin and start transforming your blocks into carousels.

= Why Any Block Carousel Slider instead of a dedicated carousel slider block? =

* **WordPress loops without friction** – Transform Query Loop and Post Template Gutenberg blocks into a "loop slider" without creating a block per slide.
* **Familiar editorial experience** – Content editors keep the Gutenberg interface they know (patterns, global styles, alignments, inner blocks).
* **Zero JavaScript on the frontend** – Native scroll, `scroll-snap`, GPU-friendly, no Swiper/Slick bundle to load.
* **Full compatibility** – Works with classic themes (including Uncode) and block themes, plus WooCommerce, ACF Blocks, custom CPTs.
* **Accessibility + SEO** – Keyboard navigation, respects `prefers-reduced-motion` preferences, clean DOM for crawling.

= What you can do in 30 seconds =

* **Blog / Magazine**: Display your latest posts in a Query Loop carousel with native filters and badges.
* **Portfolios & testimonials**: Keep your Group, Cover, Media & Text blocks and make them scrollable without rebuilding anything.
* **WooCommerce**: Transform the Products block into a responsive product carousel (promotions, best-sellers, cross-sell).
* **Landing pages**: Chain complex sections (image, title, button, Lottie) within the same slider thanks to full inner blocks compatibility.
* **ACF Blocks / CPT**: If your custom block produces a grid, a simple toggle is enough to offer a carousel version.

= Quick comparison =

- **Activation**: Any Block Carousel Slider – toggle an existing Gutenberg block. Classic carousel slider blocks – add a dedicated slider block and rebuild every slide.
- **WordPress loop**: Any Block Carousel Slider – works with Query Loop, Post Template, CPTs, and WooCommerce products without duplication. Competitor carousels – require one block per slide or custom code.
- **Frontend JavaScript**: Any Block Carousel Slider – zero JavaScript, 100% CSS carousel slider. Competitor carousels – load Swiper/Slick and additional scripts.
- **Performance**: Any Block Carousel Slider – lightweight DOM, no external assets. Competitor carousels – multiply files, reflow, and downloads.
- **Content maintenance**: Any Block Carousel Slider – single Gutenberg block to update. Competitor carousels – duplicate content in dedicated slides.
- **Security & upkeep**: Any Block Carousel Slider – no third-party libraries to monitor. Competitor carousels – depend on external JS libraries like Swiper/Slick.

= Key features =

* **100% CSS** – Smooth carousel slider with `scroll-snap`, `::scroll-button`, and `::scroll-marker`. No script to bundle.
* **Smart responsive** – Automatically handles visible columns, spacing, and control sizes according to WordPress breakpoints (1280, 1024, 782, 600, 480, 375).
* **Two width modes** – Manual mode (fixed column count) and Auto mode (fixed width like 320px) with automatic detection.
* **Gutenberg block spacing detection** – Respects `gap` and `padding` values defined in the block editor, including presets.
* **Theme colors** – Buttons automatically inherit your theme's colors and radii (via CSS variables).
* **Intact semantics** – Your Gutenberg block's tags and classes remain unchanged: perfect for SEO, schemas, and E2E testing.

= Native Gutenberg block workflow =

1. Add or edit a supported Gutenberg block (Gallery, Group, Columns, Query Loop/Post Template, WooCommerce Products, arranged patterns).
2. Enable the **Carousel** option in the Gutenberg sidebar panel (Layout or Block section depending on the block).
3. Adjust your usual settings (column count, minimum width, spacing, alignment).
4. Save: your block becomes a touch-friendly, accessible, and SEO-friendly carousel slider.

= Advanced customization =

* **Manual mode (fixed columns)** – Ideal for article carousel sliders: 1 to 6 columns depending on screen sizes.
* **Auto mode (fixed width)** – Perfect for product carousel sliders: 280px, 320px, or 360px respected pixel-perfect.
* **Padding and gaps** – Automatic management via CSS vars `--carousel-padding-*`, `--wp--style--block-gap`.
* **Themes & `theme.json`** – Override variables to align controls with your design system.
* **Graceful degradation** – If a browser doesn't support `::scroll-button`, users keep touch and mouse scrolling.

= Technical architecture =

* `render_block` hook to inject variables based on context (block type, columns, gaps).
* Dedicated service for translating labels and help messages.
* Separate editor/frontend styles for a transparent Gutenberg experience.
* Code organized by PSR-4 services (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` for details).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Any Block Carousel Slider differ from traditional carousel blocks? =

Unlike traditional carousels that force you to insert a dedicated "Carousel" block and rebuild each slide by hand, Any Block Carousel Slider turns the Gutenberg blocks you already have (Query Loop, Gallery, Products, etc.) into a slider via a simple toggle. With a Query Loop for instance, legacy solutions usually require limiting the loop to one post per slide and duplicating layouts. Here, one block is enough: single action, zero duplication, maximum performance.

= Is it compatible with all themes (block themes, FSE)? =

Yes. The Gutenberg carousel slider block plugin reads style variables generated by your theme (classic or full site editing) and applies the carousel slider without breaking the initial grid.

= Does it require JavaScript on the frontend? =

No. Everything relies on native CSS. Only a few lines of JavaScript executed in the editor handle the toggle interface. This means zero JavaScript bundle to load (unlike plugins using Swiper.js or Slick), resulting in better Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals.

= How do I transform a Query Loop into a carousel? =

Enable the Query Loop Gutenberg block (or Post Template), configure your filters and rendering, then check **Carousel**. Posts are automatically aligned on a scrollable line with snap and CSS arrows. This is the main advantage over traditional carousel slider plugins that don't support Query Loops natively.

= Can I mix images, titles, buttons, and forms in the same carousel? =

Yes. The plugin respects existing inner Gutenberg blocks. A Group block containing image + text + button (or a custom ACF block) is transformed as-is into a carousel slider.

= WooCommerce compatible? =

The **Products** Gutenberg block (List, Hand-picked Products, On Sale, etc.) works immediately as a carousel slider. Add to cart buttons remain interactive.

= Is there an autoplay mode, infinite loop, or custom arrows? =

The plugin focuses on native scroll and performance. You can add a light custom script if you want autoplay, but most sites get a better Core Web Vitals score by keeping native behavior.

= Can I have multiple carousels on the same page? =

Yes, without limit. Each Gutenberg block manages its own CSS variables for the carousel slider.

= How do I adjust buttons or position markers? =

In your theme or via a CSS snippets plugin, override the variables:

```css
.wp-block-group.is-carousel {
    --carousel-button-bg: var(--wp--preset--color--primary);
    --carousel-marker-size: 0.8rem;
}
```

= What happens if the browser doesn't support `::scroll-button`? =

Visual arrows remain visible (disabled state) and users navigate via touch scroll or mouse wheel. The experience remains responsive.
